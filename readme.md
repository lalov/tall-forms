# Project Deprecation Notice

## Important: This Package is No Longer Maintained
As of now, this package has been deprecated and is no longer being actively maintained. I've decided to shift my focus entirely to contributing to [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/), an alternative that offers all the functionalities of this package and much more.

## Why This Change?
- **Advancements in Technology:** Livewire v3 and other technological advancements have made some of the features in this package obsolete.
- **Better Alternatives:** Filament provides a more comprehensive set of features that are better suited for current development needs.

## What Does This Mean for Users?
- **No New Updates:** There will be no new features, bug fixes, or updates to this package.
- **Not Recommended for New Projects:** I strongly advise against using this package for new projects.
- **Support and Documentation:** Existing documentation will remain available, but with no updates or new additions.

## Looking for a New Maintainer
If you find value in this project and are interested in taking over its maintenance, please feel free to PM me.

## Thank You!
I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has used, contributed to, and supported this package over the years. Your engagement and feedback have been invaluable.
